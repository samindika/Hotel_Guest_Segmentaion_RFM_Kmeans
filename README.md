# Hotel_Guest_Segmentaion_RFM_Kmeans

Project Title - Guest Segmentation using RFM Analysis and K-Means Clustering in a Hotel Booking System
Data set - The dataset is obtained from the live database of a Hotel System.
Purpose - Group hotel guests and identify the characteristics of each group to implement personalized marketing strategies.
Methodology - Use three different approaches to implement the project
            1. Direct clustering with Scaled RFM parameters
            2. Quantile-Based Scoring and Clustering
            3. Direct Clustering with Skewness Adjustment

Python Scripts (Hotel_Guest_Segmentaion_RFM_Kmeans/main/src) - All three Python scripts are in .py and .ipynb formats

1. Direct clustering with Scaled RFM parameters (Customer_Segmentation_MannualOutlierDetection.ipynb/Customer_Segmentation_MannualOutlierDetection.py)
2. Quantile-Based Scoring and Clustering - (Customer_Segmentation_ScoreBasedMethod.ipynb/Customer_Segmentation_ScoreBasedMethod.py)
3. Direct Clustering with Skewness Adjustment - (Customer_Segmentation_SkewnessHandling.ipynb/Customer_Segmentation_SkewnessHandling.py) 
        
Pre-release - The initial segmentation model is in the development branch and There are 8 Pre-release python scripts.
